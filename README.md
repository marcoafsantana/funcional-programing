## About This Repository
This repository contains my solutions for the programming assignments from the Functional Programming course offered at the Centro de Informática (CIn-UFPE) during the 2025.1 academic semester. The primary goal of this collection is to document my progress and serve as a personal reference for the concepts and techniques learned throughout the course.
